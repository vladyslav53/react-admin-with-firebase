This project is using a customized version ported into React of the [Admin Dashboard Template](https://github.com/vikdiesel/admin-one-bulma-dashboard) made by [Viktor Kuzhelny](https://github.com/vikdiesel).

## What is this?

React Firebase Admin is our in house admin dashboard boilerplate that we use in many of our software projects here at [CreateThrive](https://createthrive.com/). After months of hard work and refinement we decided to make it public to give back the open source community that helped us so much along the years.

## Why should I use it?

- It is bootstraped with CRA (Create React App) this means it comes with all the good features we all know and love like built-in scripts, to make our app a PWA (Progressive Web App) and much more!.
- It is customizable.
- It uses Firebase.
- It has all the basic features you want in your app.
- It is easy to use.

## Features

- Bulma CSS framework (Mobile friendly üî•)
- Redux implementation
- Firebase/Redux implementation
- Authentication
- Create/modify/delete users
- Automatic email invitation to new users
- Image uploading
- Change/Forgot Password built into the dasbhoard.
- User filtering and search
- Built-in CI (Continous integration)
- Built-in CD (Continous deployment)
- PWA ready thanks to CRA and Firebase.
- Multi-tenancy already in place, with minimal changes it is possible to implement it.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.15.0 or higher (React frontend) and v8.17.0 (Cloud Functions) (You can install them using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor (preferred) + [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [Babel JavaScript ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel) plug-ins.

## Getting started

- Clone the project into your computer! (more info on [cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
- Create a Firebase Project in [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- In the **_Database_** section setup your database as a **_Real Time Database_** as **_locked mode_** (later on we will setup our own custom rules).
- In the **_Storage_** section setup your storage bucket with the default values provided by Firebase.
- Setup your sign-in providers in the **_Authentication_** section. On the **_Sign in method_** tab, enable **_Email/Password_** provider with the **_Email Link_** feature.
- Copy the config values you get from you Firebase dashboard's **_Web Setup_** option and enter them into a `.env` file with the same structure as the `.env.example` in the root directory of the repository.

### Setting up the Firebase project locally

First we should install the Firebase cli tool and then initialize our new Firebase project.

Run the following commands in the root of the repository:

- `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- `firebase init`

Select the firebase project you created in the previous step and then when prompted select the services we want to setup and check **_Database_**, **_Functions_** and **_Hosting_**.

**_Database_**:

- Leave the default name for our rules `.json` file.
- Select **_No_** when prompted if you want to overwrite the file containing our rules.

**_Functions_**:

- For the language to use in our functions select **_JavaScript_**.
- If we want to use ESLint as our linting tool select **_No_**.
- If we want to overwrite the `package.json`, `.gitignore` and `index.js` select **_No_**.
- Then select **_Yes_** that we want to install dependencies with npm.

**_Hosting_**:

- Set **build** as our public directory for our Hosting files.
- Select **_Yes_** when asked if we want to be our Hosting configured as a single page application.

Run the following commands in the `functions/` folder (Using Node v8.17.0):

- `npm run setup-firebase`

You will get prompted to enter the path to you service account key file. To generate it, go to your **_Firebase Dashboard_**, **_Project settings_** tab and then to **_Service accounts_** option and right on there you can generate your private key (more info on this [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk)).

Then you will have to enter the **_email_** and **_password_** for the admin account of the admin dashboard. With this on place, you successfully created your admin account for the dashboard.

### Setting up the React frontend

Run the following commands in the root of the repository (Using Node v12.15.0 or higher ):

- `npm run setup-admin-dashboard`

Now if you enter to your dashboard you will see that all the Firebase services are now deployed, enter the **_Functons_** section and copy your Cloud Functions URL and paste it into the `REACT_APP_CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_REST_API` environment variable in your `.env` file.

It should like something like this:

`REACT_APP_CLOUD_FUNCTIONS_REST_API = '<CLOUD FUNCTION URL>/requestsApp'`

At this point we should have the a fully functional admin dashboard. You can start a local development server with the command `npm run start` or visit your Firebase Dashboard and in the **_Hosting_** tab find out the url that your project is hosted.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production-key.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging-key.json
```

### Installing dependencies

From the functions folder run:

```javascript
npm install
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Authenticate to your Firebase account

```javascript
firebase login
```

### Listing Firebase projects

```javascript
firebase projects:list
```

### Listing aliases available in the project

```javascript
firebase use
```

### Selecting an alias

We should use staging alias while testing new functionality.

```javascript
firebase use staging
```

### Creating a new cloud function

Functions are automatically loaded from the index.js file if you follow the naming convention and folder structure, no need to add it manually.

Naming:

<ul>
    <li>The naming of functions should indicate the trigger and not what they are doing.</li>
    <li>Name your files according to the trigger you use ( onWrite, onCreate, onUpdate , onChange and onDelete).</li>
    <li>Functions should end with .function.js to get loaded.</li>
</ul>

Folders:

<ul>
    <li>Functions should be stored inside the folder they are triggers. For example: the function onCreate.function.js inside auth/, triggers when a new user is created on the authentication service of Firebase.</li>
</ul>

### Testing functions locally

At the moment we're limited to only test functions locally and no other services of Firebase like Realtime Database, Firestore, etc. So be cautious that your local functions will be interacting with real services.

Cloud functions run in a Node.js environment with version 8 and the React front end with LTS or the latest one. So a tool like [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) comes in handy to change seamlessly Node versions between terminal windows.

To initialize the emulator with functions only run:

```javascript
firebase emulators:start --only functions
```

After it initialize you should get your endpoints to test your HTTP functions in case you have some:

```javascript
‚úî  functions[requestsApp]: http function initialized (http://localhost:5001/...../requestsApp).
```

More information about the [Firebase Emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/emulator-setup).

### Deployment

When a pull request gets merged into development, functions are deployed automatically deployed to the staging project on Firebase. The same when merging/pushing into master it's deployed to production.

Also we have the option to deploy manually our project with the following command.

```javascript
firebase deploy
```

This will deploy Hosting, Functions and DB rules. Be sure to build the React frontend before deploying to Firebase if we introduced changes to it.

If we want to deploy only certain service of Firebase we can do it with the following command. In this example we only deploy our functions.

```
firebase deploy --only functions
```

It's possible to deploy only a function in especific.

```
firebase deploy --only functions:myFunction
```

Also we can deploy more than one at a time.

```
firebase deploy --only functions:myFunction,functions:anotherfunction
```

## Continuous integration/deployment

We use use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for our CI/CD needs. It consists of workflows writen in a .yml file similar to other CI/CD tools like travis, jenkins, etc.

Each workflow is triggerd by events like push, commits and other [GitHub API events](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows).

### Workflows folder structure

```bash
.github/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production-deployment.yml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pull-requests.yml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging-deployment.yml
```

### Active workflows in the project

<ul>
    <li>Pull requests: gets triggerd on pull request of branches: master, feature/* and development. It builds and runs the tests of the React frontend.</li>
    <li>Staging deployment: gets triggered on commits in the development branch. It builds the React frontend and deploys: hosting, functions and DB rules.</li>
    <li>Production deployment: gets triggered on commits in the master branch. It builds the React frontend and deploys: hosting, functions and DB rules.</li>
</ul>

### Setting up GitHub Actions in your repo

To get up and running the workflows we mentioned previously you will need to have two Firebase Projects, one it will be your production environment and the other one your staging one.

You will need to setup all of your Environment Variables we setup earlier as [GitHub Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets), both for your Staging and Production projects.

Also, you will need to setup your `FIREBASE_TOKEN` secret. You get this token by login in using the command `firebase login:ci` in your terminal. More info on this [Firebase login CI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#cli-ci-systems).

After setting up all your github secrets they should look like this:

![Boilerplate - GitHub Secrets first part](https://i.imgur.com/1gHyjuU.png)
![Boilerplate - GitHub Secrets second part](https://i.imgur.com/PhVIteg.png)

### Writing new workflows

You can refere to this on the [GitHub Actions documentations](https://help.github.com/en/actions).

## Environment Variables

Refere to the .env.example file in the root folder of the project to see what variables are currently in use.
